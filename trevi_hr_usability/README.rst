Make Employee Records and Contracts Easier to Work With
=======================================================
#. Make the job id in employee object reference job id in latest contract.
#. When moving from employee to contract pre-populate the employee field.
#. In the contract form show only those positions belonging to the
   department the employee belongs to.
#. Make country (nationality) default to Ethiopia
#. Make official identification document number unique
#. Employees can only access their own contracts unless they're an HR Officer
