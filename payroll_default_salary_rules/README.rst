This module defines a default set of salary rule and category code settings that can be used by an
administrator to specify the codes of often used rules and categories. Developers can then rely on
the codes configured in those settings to develop their modules regardless of the actual codes
used by the administrator.  Salary rule categories modeled after these settings are made available.
Additionaly a very basic set of salary rules that are essential to correct payslip calculations
are included.
In addition this module allows salary rule categories to be archived.
