Define Time Bank Accrual Policies
=================================
Define properties of a leave accrual policy. The accrued time is calculated
based on the length of service of the employee. An additional premium may be
added on the base rate based on additional months of service. This policy is ideal
for annual leave accruals. If the type of accrual is 'Standard' time is accrued and
withdrawn manually. However, if the type is 'Calendar' the time is accrued (and recorded)
at a fixed frequency.
