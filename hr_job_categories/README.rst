Attach Categories (Tags) to Employees Based on Job Position
===========================================================

This module is useful for tagging employees based on their job positions. For example,
all Supervisors could be attached to the Supervisors category. Define which categries
a job belongs to in the configuration for the job. When an employee is assigned a particular
job the categories attached to that job will be attached to the employee record as well.
