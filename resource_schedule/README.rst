Easily create, manage, and track employee shift planning.

#. Work Detail Templates - templates describe a shift for one day. For example: 8 a.m to 5 p.m.
#. Work Detail - the Odoo record for describing a day in a Work Time. These records can get their settings from a Work Detail Template.
#. Work Time - the Odoo record for describing a weekly schedule.
#. Shift Schedule - the actual times that an employee is scheduled to work on a specific day.
#. Schedule Area - the area the employee is assigned to for a shift. For example, in a hotel with multiple dinning rooms all serving staff may have the same shifts but be assigned to different dinning rooms.
#. Schedule Group - schedule groups allow an organization to split employees into groups. Schedule groups can have their own work detail templates and managers who are responsible for managing shifts.
