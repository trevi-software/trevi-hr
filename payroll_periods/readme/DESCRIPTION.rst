Easy Payroll Management
-----------------------
This module implements a more formal payroll cycle. This cycle is based on payroll period schedules configured by the user. Based on the configured schedule payroll periods are periodicaly created in advance. When a payroll period ends the state is automatically set to 'Ended'. A manual schedule can also be created, in which case the payroll manager must create payroll periods individually.
